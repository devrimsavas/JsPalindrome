Palindrome Checker
This small js function determines if the input text is a palindromeâ€”a sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. Users simply enter a phrase, click "Check", and the program quickly analyzes and displays whether the input is a palindrome or not. It's a handy tool for language enthusiasts and curious minds alike.
I used an easy CSS and HTML.
